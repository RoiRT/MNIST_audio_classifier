# Multiclass Audio Classification MINST


## Description

Multiclass Audio Classification MINST is a project focused on developing an advanced machine learning model to classify audio data with numbers from 0 to 9. The goal is to perform an EDA analysis of the data and then use a convolutional model to accurately identify and classify various audio samples into multiple classes, including different digits spoken by different individuals.
